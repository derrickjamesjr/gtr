# Work Day Organizer

This document is a work-day orgainzer made to organize task for the usual work day hours of 9:00am - 5:00 pm.

I started out by creating the task boxes for each of the times directly on the HTML file. I then gave them styles using bootstrap and gave them appropriate ids and classes based on the definitions given inside the already made CSS styles. After this, I began working on making sure that the task spaces were textboxes and able to take in text as well as be able to hold text to save. I set the text boxes to save to localStorage so that whenever it is refreshed, the tasks will remain on the page at the time where it was saved. I used Moment to show the current date and time on the front page for whever is using it at the time.
